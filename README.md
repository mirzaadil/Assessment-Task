# Assessment-task

# Overview
- This application show Transaction screen with currency formatted number. 

# App Features
- The application will be show custom number transaction screen.

# App Architecture
- Application is built with clean code architecture suggested by the Google Android Developers.
- This project includes
- Kotlin - First class and official programming language for Android development.
-  Retrofit - Integrate with network layer and fetch data from API.
- Coroutines - For asynchronous and more.
- Android Architecture Components - Collection of libraries that help you design
robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
- Flow - A flow is an asynchronous version of a Sequence, a type of collection
whose values are lazily produced.
- Jetpack DataStore - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows
- you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore
uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and
transactionally
- LiveData - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database
changes.
